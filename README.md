## ðŸ“‹ Setup & Usage

### Installation

Add this plugin via DatoCMS Settings > Plugins > Add (`/admin/plugins/new`).

### Enabling on a Field

1. Navigate to your model settings in DatoCMS
2. Select the Text or JSON field you want to enhance
3. In the Presentation tab, select "Phone Number" from the Field Editor dropdown
4. Save your changes

### Configuration Options

- **Include countries**: Select countries you would like to include
- **Exclude countries**: Select countries you would like to exclude
- **Default country**: Select the default country. This will be automatically set when the field is empty

You can only use include or exclude countries, not both. When one is filled, the other is disabled. You will have to empty it before you can use the other. Based on the included or excluded countries the options in the default country will be updated.

### Data Output

- For Text fields: Stores the formatted international phone number as a string
  ```json
  {
    "phoneNumber": "+31612345678",
  }
  ```
- For JSON fields: Stores comprehensive phone data
  ```json
  {
    "phoneNumber": {
      "country": "NL",
      "countryCallingCode": "31",
      "nationalNumber": "612345678",
      "number": "+31612345678",
      "__countryCallingCodeSource": "FROM_NUMBER_WITH_PLUS_SIGN"
    }
  }
  ```
